1. Description of the data
=======================================

The French Treebank (Abeillé et al., 2003) is a treebank of sentences from 
the newspaper Le Monde, manually annotated with morphological information and 
phrase-structure.

The phrase-structure trees contain compound words, for which a part-of-speech node
dominates a sequence of part-of-speech nodes for the components of the compound word.

Some of the sentences are further annotated with functional tags (grammatical functions 
annotated on syntagmatic nodes) (Abeillé and Barrier, 2004).

For the SPMRL Shared Task, the data corresponds to the part of the French Treebank 
that contains functional annotations.

We provide 6 versions of the treebank, each of them split into train and dev sets,
leading to a total of 16 files.

The 6 versions vary along three dimensions :

  - syntactic representation type : constituency versus dependency

  - representation of compound words : expanded  

  - origin of POS and morphological features : gold versus predicted

We describe below these three distinctions in more detail :

** Syntactic representation type  
   =============================
   We provide the treebank both in constituency format and in dependency format, resulting from automatic
   conversion to dependencies (Candito et al., 2010).

   The tag set used for constituency trees is the one defined by (Crabbé and Candito, 2008),
   and contains POS that combine the coarse tag of the original treebank and some morphological information
   such as verbal mood, proper/common noun distinction etc...

   The constituency trees were automatically slightly modified to normalize the syntagmatic projection
   of prepositions and complementizers, in order to have prepositions and complementizers as heads in the
   dependency trees, as described in (Candito et al. 2010).

 
** Representation of compound words (or "multi word expressions")
   ==============================================================
   We provide the treebank both with "expanded" compound words 
   (as encoded in the original treebank)
   and with each multi word expression merged as one token
   (entailing a bijection between tokens and words)

   In the expanded versions, we concatenated a "+" to the part-of-speech tag dominating a compound word
   in order to easily spot them. This can be also easily suppressed.

   Example : for the sentence 
             "La caisse d'épargne avait fermé la veille." 
	     (The savings bank had closed the day before.)

   The provided constituency tree with expanded compound words is :
   (without the morphological features)

   ( (SENT (NP-SUJ (DET La) (NC+ (NC caisse) (P d') (NC épargne))) (VN (V avait) (VPP fermé)) (ADV+ (DET la) (NC veille)) (PONCT .)) )

   The compound word "caisse d'épargne" (savings bank) corresponds to the three tokens 
   (NC caisse) (P d') (NC épargne)
   which are dominated by the special POS tag NC+, for "a common noun which is a compound word"

   Note that a version of the data set with merged compound (ie (ADV la_veille) instead of (ADV+ (DET la) (NC veille)) )
   can be made available to the participants. We decided to finally not include that version in order to reduce the risk
   of confusion. 
  

** Origin of POS and morphological features
   ========================================
   We provide the treebank both with gold morphological features and parts-of-speech
   and with predicted morphological features and parts-of-speech, 
   using the Morfette tool (Chrupala, 2008) adapted to French (Seddah et al., 2010)

   Note though that in the original treebank,
   the gold morphological features are available for words only,
   and not for tokens that are components of words.
   So for the compound (NC+ (NC caisse) (P d') (NC épargne)),
   only the NC+ node has gold lemma and morpho features.
   The (NC caisse) node for instance, only has gold part-of-speech.

   Hence in the versions with "expanded" compound words,
   even for the files with "gold" morphology,
   the lemma and features for the components of compounds
   were predicted with morfette.

=======================================
2. Formats
=======================================

   The constituency trees are provided in bracketed format, with one sentence per line.

   The syntagmatic symbols are of the form SYMBOL or SYMBOL-FUNCTIONTAG (e.g. "NP" or "NP-SUJ")

   The part-of-speech symbols are of the form POS-FCT##FEAT1=VAL1,FEAT2=VAL2,...##
   - The part -FCT for the functional tag is optional.
   - The features contain at least the lemma.
     ( e.g. "NC" or "CLS-SUJ" or "NC##lemma=enfance,g=f,n=s##" or "CLS-SUJ##lemma=il,g=f,n=p##" )

The dependency trees are provided in conll format (CoNLL 2006 Shared task)
( see http://ilk.uvt.nl/conll/#dataformat ).

For the expanded compound mode, the head of the token is systematically the first token of the compound,
and it bears a feature (mwehead)  the POS tag of the compound.

For instance, for the compound (ADV+ (DET la) (NC veille))   "the day before"
the first token "la" has its feature mwehead set  to the ADV+ part-of-speech,
and the second token "veille" keeps its NC tag, and depends on "la", with the special label "dep_cpd"

4. Licence
=======================================

The French treebank is distributed freely for research purposes, provided you fill and return the licence
that can be found here : http://www.llf.cnrs.fr/Gens/Abeille/French-Treebank-fr.php

The organizers of SPMRL 2013 shared task will provide the participants the licence to fill
and will transmit the filled licences to Anne Abeillé.


=======================================
5. Version history
=======================================

The whole French Treebank contains sentences with associated phrase-structure trees.
Since the first release in 2004, only part of these sentences also contained functional annotations.

The number of sentences with functionally annotated sentences is growing,
as new syntagmatic trees are augmented with functional tags.
The total number of fully annotated sentences was:
- 12351 in 2007
- 15953 in 2010
- 18535 in 2013

For the SPMRL Shared Task, we use the 2013 data, with the following split:
- 14759 sentences for training   (the first 9981 sentences correspond to the canonical 2007 training set)
-  1235 sentences for development
-  2541 sentences for final test (not provided yet)

7. Appendix: tag set and morphological features
=======================================

7.1  Divergences with the the Candito et al's (2010) FTBDep version:

- debug of the distinction between the catagories P and P+D :
  now compound prepositions can bear the category P+D if they amalgamate the determiner
  (e.g. "à cause du" (because of the) will have category P+D, like "du" (of the))

- various debugs in constituency to dependency conversion including reducing the cases of missing heads 
  and better prediction of labels absent from the constituency trees

- specialization of the obj function into
  obj (verbal objects), 
  obj.p (objects of prepositions), 
  obj.cpl (objects of complementizers)

- renaming of "mod_rel", "aux_*", "dep_coord" labels to "mod.rel", "aux.*" and "dep.coord" respectively

- complement versus adjunct distinction for prepositional dependents of adjectives or adverbs :
  (possible labels for prepositional dependents of adjectives and adverbs are :
  "mod" for modifiers, and "a_obj", "de_obj" or "p_obj" for complements

- handling of coordination of determiners as normal coordination (despite the absence of DP in the FTB)
  and better handling of ranges of determiners :
  "trois ou quatre personnes" (three or four people) => coordinating conjunction now depends on the first determiner
  "trois à quatre personnes" (three to four people) => "à" (to) now regularly depends on the first determiner

** pred:   Feature that indicates that the morphology for a given token has been generated and not manually validated
(this includes the lemma, the feature field  and the FPOS tag, the CPOS is gold.)
